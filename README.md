Snapshot data and airdrop merkle proofs for Prisma airdrops.

- `data/vecrv.json` - veCRV balances that voted for Curve DAO Ownership vote 394. Convex's vote has been substituted with weights of individual vlCLX voters.

### Note

Airdrops are not yet finalized. All data published prior to the actual airdrop is for reference only and subject to change.

Please [contact us](https://discord.gg/prismafinance) if you operate a protocol that is eligible for an airdrop, but would receive it to a smart contract that is unable to [call to claim](https://github.com/prisma-fi/prisma-contracts/blob/4e250c0e3964808ea356339873dc9984e6116a43/contracts/dao/AirdropDistributor.sol#L87).
